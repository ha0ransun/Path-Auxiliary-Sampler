Please refer to [Optimal Scaling for Locally Balanced Proposals in Discrete Spaces](https://github.com/ha0ransun/LBP_Scale) for 
* The theortically otpimal acceptance rate for path auxiliary sampler.
* How to select the optimal path length for path auxiliary sampler.
* A more efficient implementation of path auxiliary sampler.
